# My Awesome Config


Awesome is a highly configurable, tiling window manager for X. It is very fast, extensible and licensed under the GNU GPLv2 license.  
# Features
* Configured in Python.
* A documented API to configure and define the behavior of your window manager.

# My Keybindings

The MODKEY is set to the Super key (aka the Windows key).  I try to keep the
keybindings consistent with all of my window managers.
